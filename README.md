# Scrabble
A clone of the popular Board Game created in Java, which displays advanced object oriented programming principles.

Welcome to the repository for Scrabble, a faithful clone of the beloved classic board game implemented in Java. This project serves as a testament to the versatility and power of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Throughout its development, advanced OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction have been diligently applied to create a robust and extensible codebase.

Features
Our Java clone of Scrabble captures the essence of the original game, featuring:

Accurate Game Logic: All rules and gameplay mechanics have been meticulously replicated to match the original game experience.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly GUI that provides an intuitive and interactive gaming experience, built using Swing/AWT.
Multiplayer Support: The game supports multiple players, just like the traditional board game.
